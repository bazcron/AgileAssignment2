npm testAgile-Assignment-1
Name of webApp: Agree or Disagree

Created by: Barry Cronin Student Num: 20074828 github link to project: https://github.com/bazcron/Agile-Assignment-1

This is my API test automation & Source Control Project.

Using my original webApp code for AgreeORdisagree i implemented tests for the 2 models i currently have, Statements and Users.

Statements Model: let mongoose = require('mongoose'); let statementSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ id: Number, statement: String, agree: Number, disagree:Number }, { collection: 'statements' }); module.exports = mongoose.model('statements', statementSchema);

Users Model: let mongoose = require('mongoose'); let usersSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ id: Number, name: String, email: String, password: String, agree: Number, disagree: Number }, { collection: 'users' }); module.exports = mongoose.model('users', usersSchema);

I opened a terminal and set up an initial git repository inside the project folder: git init

i then created a .gitignore file with the following text: /node_modules .log package-lock.json /**/.DS_Store DS_Store

which excludes all the node_modules, log files and anything named .ds_store

i set up an initial commit: git add -A git commit -m "Initial project structure"

i then ran: npm install

i then ran: git checkout master, to make sure it was on the master branch i then created a new branch: git branch add-users-test

where i added my test code to the project and ran the tests, all tests passed

i then went back to the master branch, git checkout master i then merged the branch with git merge add-users-test

i then created another branch, add-statements-test and wrote and tested test code for the statement route

this was also merged and pushed to github.
